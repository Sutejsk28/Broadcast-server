# Broadcast-server
link for client side of this application: https://github.com/Sutejsk28/Broadcast-client

It is a backend application for an forum site, it provides REST APIs for various functionalities such as creating users, authenticating users, add posts and much more. 
The application uses spring boot which is a java based framework and uses MySQL as it's database. 
I've used spring data jpa for the connectivity between the application and the database and spring security for authentication of users. 
The application uses MVC architecture and makes sure all the different modules are present in different packages for better code readability. 
I thought of creating this as India does not have any website where people could discuss on various topics of their intrest, 
Hence I created broadcast an web application where people can create various pages and post on those pages, other users can upvote or downvote the posts, write comments on the post and look at all the posts put up by a user.


I learnt about the MVC architecture and how to write user readable code. 
I learned how to connect to database such as MySQL using spring data jpa and how to write queries that fetch the desired data from the database.
I learned about various diffrent annotations present in spring boot which help make development process much faster such as @Controllers, @Repository @Services etc. 
I also learned about using spring security for user authentication using JSON Web Tokens(JWT) and how to authorise users based on JWT.
